# How MusicX is built, and why

The decisions in here are load-bearing: things that look like mistakes until you know the reason, and things that will quietly break if changed without one. The [README](../README.md) covers what the project does and how to run it.

## The shape of it

```
frontend (Vite + React + Tailwind)  ──proxy /api──▶  backend (FastAPI)
                                                      ├─ embed.py       Spotify URL → metadata
                                                      ├─ deezer.py      search, artists, Deezer URLs
                                                      ├─ itunes.py      search, Apple Music URLs
                                                      ├─ soundcloud.py  search + SoundCloud URLs
                                                      ├─ ytdlp.py       YouTube/SoundCloud URLs + search
                                                      ├─ downloader.py  find audio → encode → tags
                                                      ├─ jobs.py        thread pool + progress + sweeper
                                                      ├─ limits.py      per-caller budgets
                                                      └─ analytics.py   SQLite counters + /admin
```

nginx in the frontend container serves the built app **and** proxies `/api` to the backend over the internal network. Same origin, so there is no CORS layer and no second domain.

Every metadata provider is public and keyless — no account, no API key, nothing that can be revoked or start charging per call. That constraint is why there is no Spotify Web API integration: since 2025 it requires the app owner to hold an active Premium subscription. Spotify links are read from the public embed pages instead.

Jobs live in memory, not a database. A restart loses in-flight progress and that is an accepted trade: the files on disk are the durable artifact, and a queue would be a second stateful service for a project whose premise is that it needs none.

## Farsi only, no i18n layer

The frontend targets Persian speakers. All UI copy is written directly in Farsi in the components — no i18n framework, no strings file, no language switcher. A bilingual toggle was rejected because it doubles the copy surface and adds a dependency to a ~10-component app with a single audience.

- The register is informal-but-clean spoken Persian (محاوره‌ی مرتب): spoken-register verbs, English loanwords in Persian script where they are the natural word («دانلود»، «پلی‌لیست»), no slang. Error and destructive-action copy is one notch calmer than the rest.
- **The hero `h1` and all `<head>` metadata** (title, meta description, OG/Twitter, JSON-LD, manifest) use neutral *written* Persian instead, because those surfaces target organic search and Persian search queries are written-register («دانلود موزیک», not «موزیک دانلود کن»). Everything rendered in-app below the h1 stays محاوره.
- The brand is **«آنستریم»** in all user-facing copy. Latin "MusicX" survives only in developer-facing places: the repo, package names, cache keys, code comments.
- **Backend and axios error strings surface in English on purpose** (`apiError` in `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`). Translating them client-side was considered and rejected. Do not "fix" this without a decision.
- Backend-composed result *subtitles* ("5 releases", "by X · 40 tracks") are the exception: `localizeSubtitle` rewrites them to Farsi at the API seam, so the backend response stays English. **New subtitle phrases added in the backend must be added to that map too**, or they reach the UI in English.
- The `/admin` dashboard is English and LTR — the only surface that is. This governs the product, and that page is not the product: it is owner-facing and its screenshots are meant to travel.

`CONTEXT.md` fixes the canonical Farsi rendering of each domain term. Copy changes should agree with it.

<a id="typeface"></a>

## One self-hosted typeface

A single self-hosted Persian typeface serves both `--font-display` and `--font-sans`; heading contrast comes from weight, not family. Self-hosting — preload, `font-display: swap`, a metric-tuned fallback — exists to make font loading effectively instant, so reintroducing any third-party font request defeats the point.

It must be a **Farsi-digit cut**: one that renders ASCII digits as Persian numerals (۱۲۳) from the font itself, so nothing in the app has to transliterate numbers.

The font is **Vazirmatn FD** ([SIL OFL 1.1](https://github.com/rastikerdar/vazirmatn), by Saber Rastikerdar). It replaced Peyda FaNum, which is a commercial font from fontiran.com — survivable while the repo was private, a licensing problem the moment open-sourcing came up, since publishing would have handed a paid font to everyone who cloned it. Estedad was the other candidate and lost on mechanics: its releases ship no FD build, only a generator script. `OFL.txt` travels with the fonts because the licence requires it.

- The FD cut turns digits Persian app-wide — durations, bitrates, and digits inside English song titles ("24K Magic" → "۲۴K Magic"). Deliberate. Do not swap in the plain cut without a decision.
- Nine weights are registered, four (400/500/600/700) preloaded. A new weight class in the design needs its preload added.
- **Preload `href`s must match the CSS `url()`s exactly**, or browsers download every font twice.
- The fallback's `size-adjust` / `ascent-override` / `descent-override` are measured, not guessed: mean Persian-glyph advance against Tahoma for the size-adjust, then the font's hhea metrics (2100/1100 at upm 2048) divided by it. **Changing the typeface means re-measuring them**, or the no-layout-shift guarantee quietly stops holding.

## Analytics, recorded server-side

MusicX counts its own usage into a SQLite file on the `analytics` volume, read back through a token-gated `/admin` page in the existing React app. Plausible, Umami and GA were all rejected: a hosted one costs money or an account, a self-hosted one is a second container and a second database for a project whose premise is that it needs neither.

Almost every event is recorded **server-side**, inside endpoints that already run. Only page views and a couple of browser-only moments come from a `sendBeacon`. So the numbers are not something an ad blocker can subtract, and the page pays nothing to collect them.

- **No cookie, no raw IP, no consent banner.** A caller is `sha256(salt + ip + user-agent + day)`, truncated, with a random per-install salt in the database. The rotation is the point: it gives daily uniques and makes "returning visitor" **impossible to measure**. That metric is not missing by accident — do not add a durable id to get it back.
- **Search queries are stored as text**, deliberately: a top-searched leaderboard is the most shareable number the project has. Queries are only ever joined to that day's hash. If it stops feeling proportionate, drop the `label` on `search` events and the leaderboard goes with it.
- Writes go through a bounded queue drained by one thread and are **dropped when it is full**. Analytics can lose events; it can never slow down or fail a download. Every `record()` swallows its own errors, and an unwritable volume disables the subsystem rather than breaking startup.
- **`ADMIN_TOKEN` is the project's only secret.** Unset, `/api/admin/*` returns 503 and the dashboard does not exist — it cannot accidentally end up public. Failed token attempts are rate-limited and that guard is not configurable.
- Rows are kept `ANALYTICS_RETENTION_DAYS` (90), swept hourly by the same writer thread. Counters live in one process, exactly like `limits.py` — fine for the single container, a rethink if the API is ever scaled out.
- The **`analytics` volume is the only copy of the history**. Unlike `downloads` it is not disposable; losing it loses every number the project has had. The README has the SQLite-safe backup command.

## Recommendations in-process, and off by default

"More like this" is a content-based model — 23 numbers per song, standardized, cosine similarity — merged in from a standalone notebook (`research/content-based-recommender/`). Three decisions are worth keeping.

- **A module in the API, not a second service.** The whole model is a 28k×23 float matrix and one dot product; a separate container would add a network hop, a Dockerfile and a deployment to something that answers in microseconds. pandas and scikit-learn are imported *inside* the functions that need them, so an instance that never asks for a recommendation never pays the import — that property has a test, because it is the thing an innocent-looking top-level import silently breaks.
- **Similarity on demand, never precomputed.** The obvious optimization is an NxN matrix at build time. For 28,372 songs that is ~6 GB; one row against the matrix is faster than reading the file would be. The notebook found this first and it survives the port.
- **The libraries are an extra, not a dependency.** pandas, scikit-learn and scipy are 670 MB of image (1.82 GB with them, 1.15 GB without, measured) for a feature that needs a Kaggle account to use at all, so `WITH_RECOMMENDER=0` builds an image without them. That only works because "no libraries" and "no dataset" collapse into the same unavailable — a second failure mode with its own message and its own status code would be a worse trade than the 670 MB.
- **Absent data disables a feature, never the app.** The dataset is licensed on Kaggle, so it cannot ship here — which makes "not installed" the default state, not an error condition. The endpoint answers 503, `/api/recommend/status` says so, and the UI asks before it offers anything. The same shape as `ADMIN_TOKEN`: unset means the surface does not exist, rather than existing and failing.

An album or playlist is one **centroid**, not a merge of each track's neighbours. The union answers "more like track 3" twelve times and is won by whichever member is most typical; the average answers what the record is like as a set, for the same single pass over the matrix. Members are excluded from their own results, a repeated title is counted once so a deluxe edition cannot drag the centroid toward its duplicates, and the response says how many tracks were actually known — a thin answer for a 20-track playlist the dataset knows two songs from is the dataset's limit, not the model's, and the UI says so.

The recommendations are also deliberately *not* merged into `/api/search`. They come from a fixed 28k-song catalog, most of what this app can download is not in it, and quietly mixing those misses into search results would make search look broken. A pick is fed back through search instead, which is the only path that ends in a download.

## Run it yourself

YouTube treats a datacenter address differently from a home one. From a VPS it answers `LOGIN_REQUIRED` at the playability check — before a proof-of-origin token is asked for and before a JS challenge exists to solve — so the defences the image carries cannot reach the point where they would help. Signing in with cookies moves yt-dlp onto the web clients where those defences *do* matter, which is why all three are needed together on a server and none are needed on a laptop.

That asymmetry is not a bug to fix here. It is why the same code works instantly at home and fails on a rented box, and it makes "run it yourself" the configuration where the project is at its best: no bot checks, no shared account carrying everyone's downloads, no operator in between. The legal shape agrees — distributing the software puts each person in charge of what they download, which is the position yt-dlp, spotDL and MeTube occupy.

Keeping a public instance working needs egress from a non-datacenter address: a residential or ISP proxy, which costs money. That is planned, not ruled out. It changes no code — `compose.dokploy.yml` already keeps the per-caller limits hardcoded on, and those limits stop being decorative the moment a public instance can actually serve people. The keyless rule is about *metadata providers*; renting an IP does not touch it.

Rejected along the way: a **split architecture** with the frontend on a VPS and a download worker at home — it gets a residential IP free and is strictly worse, since every stranger's download then traces to one home ISP account. And a **SoundCloud-only public demo**, which would work forever but advertises a downloader that mostly cannot download.

Consequences that outlive the decision:

- `docker-compose.yml` must work on a fresh clone with no `.env`, no external network and no file mounts. `compose.dokploy.yml` is the deployment. A change to one is not automatically right for the other.
- Defaults differ by audience on purpose: the **code's** defaults are public-safe (downloads expire, disk capped, limits tight) and the self-hosting compose file overrides them toward "this is my machine". Anything new with a limit attached needs a decision on both sides.
- The bot-check apparatus — deno, the challenge solver, the PO token provider — stays in the image even though most self-hosters never need it. It costs nothing idle, and the day YouTube starts asking a home address for a token is not a day to spend reading documentation.
