"""Turning the rate limiters off, and what stays on when you do.

A public instance without these is an open relay. A laptop with them is just
annoying. The switch exists for the second case — but "off" has to mean off
for fair-share budgets only, because the admin limiter is not one: it charges
wrong tokens, so the only caller who ever feels it is one guessing at the
dashboard password.
