"""What the downloads sweeper is allowed to delete.

The limits exist because a public server's disk is shared with strangers.
Someone self-hosting has the opposite problem — they want the files they
downloaded to still be there tomorrow — so both limits have an off switch,
and 0 is the value anyone would reach for to set it. These tests pin that
0 means "keep everything" and not, as it read literally before, "everything
is older than zero hours ago, delete it all".
