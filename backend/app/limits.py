"""Per-client limits for a public deployment.

No accounts, so the only handle on a caller is their IP. Counters are in
memory, per process — enough for the single-container stack this project ships
(docker-compose.yml); anything scaled out would need a shared store.

Two different things live here, and only one of them is about strangers:

* The **rate limiters** price what a caller can ask for per minute or hour.
  They exist because a public instance is an open relay without them, and
  they are noise on a machine whose only user is the person who installed it
  — so RATE_LIMITS_ENABLED=false switches them off in one move. The admin
  limiter is exempt: it charges *failed* token attempts, which is a
  brute-force guard, and a private instance that someone port-forwarded by
  accident needs it more than a public one, not less.

* The **job caps** below bound what one request can cost in threads and
  memory. Those are true of any deployment, so they stay on when the rate
  limiters are off, and are widened rather than disabled — 0 for no limit.

Messages stay English at the wire; the Farsi UI translates at the API seam
(`localizeError` in frontend/src/lib/api.ts).
