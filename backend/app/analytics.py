"""Self-hosted usage analytics — no third party, no cookies, no raw IPs.

Every interesting thing that happens becomes one row in a SQLite table.
Most events are recorded server-side inside the endpoints that already
exist, so an ad blocker can't hide them and the page pays nothing to be
for free; only page views need the browser to say anything (see
`/api/collect` in main.py).

Writes go through a queue drained by one background thread. Nothing on a
request path or a download worker ever touches the disk, and a full queue
drops events rather than slowing anything down — analytics must never be
able to break a download.

A caller is identified by `visitor_id()`: a hash of IP + user agent + the
day, salted with a secret generated once per install. It gives daily
unique counts without storing an address or setting a cookie. The cost is
deliberate: because the hash rotates at midnight, nobody can be followed
from one day to the next, so there is no "returning visitor" metric.
