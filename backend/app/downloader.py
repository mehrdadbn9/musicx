"""Find a track's audio, download it, encode it and tag it.

Pipeline per track:
  1. If the track already points at a YouTube/SoundCloud page (source_url),
     download that directly. Otherwise yt-dlp `ytsearch8:` for
     "<artists> - <title>" and pick the result whose duration is closest to
     the catalog duration (rejects live versions, hour-long mixes, etc.).
  2. Download bestaudio. For an mp3 quality, yt-dlp's ffmpeg postprocessor
     encodes at the requested bitrate (and if it leaves a non-mp3 audio
     file behind, we convert it ourselves rather than failing). For
     "original", the upload's own stream is kept as-is — no re-encode.
  3. Embed tags + album art from the catalog metadata with mutagen, in
     whatever tag format the resulting container speaks.

Retries exclude the exact video that just failed, and the final attempt
searches SoundCloud instead of YouTube, so one broken upload never sinks
the track.
