"""In-memory download jobs.

A job is one batch of tracks (a playlist, an album, or a single song).
Tracks download concurrently on a small thread pool; the frontend polls
GET /api/jobs/{id} for per-track progress.

A background sweeper keeps the downloads folder from growing forever:
job directories older than DOWNLOADS_TTL_HOURS (default 24) are deleted
once their job has finished, and orphan directories from previous runs
are cleaned the same way. Whatever outlives that pass is then held under
MAX_DOWNLOADS_GB by evicting the oldest jobs first.

Either limit can be switched off with 0, and a self-hosted instance
downloading into a folder someone actually browses usually switches both
off — the sweeper exists because a public server's disk is shared with
strangers, which is not true of a laptop or a NAS.
