"""Resolve and search YouTube / SoundCloud through yt-dlp — no key, no account.

yt-dlp already knows how to read public YouTube and SoundCloud pages, so the
same dependency that fetches the audio can also act as a metadata provider:

  * resolve():  a video / track / playlist / set / album URL -> Collection
  * search_youtube() / search_soundcloud():  text query -> SearchResults

Tracks resolved here carry `source_url`, so the downloader grabs that exact
page instead of running a YouTube search for a match.

# YouTube bot-checks datacenter IPs ("Sign in to confirm you're not a bot")
# long before it bothers a home connection, which is why downloads can work
# locally and fail on a VPS. Three answers to that, all configured from the
# environment, so a server that starts failing needs a restart rather than a
# release.
#
# The first is the JS challenge solver. YouTube's player hands out challenges
# that have to be *executed* to turn a format into a URL, and yt-dlp needs two
# things to do it: a JavaScript runtime (deno, in the Dockerfile) and the
# solver script itself, which it declines to fetch unless asked. Without the
# script the runtime alone is useless — yt-dlp reports "Signature solving
# failed" and returns a video with no audio streams on it. It is off by
# default upstream because it downloads code at runtime; that trade is worth
# making here and nowhere near the trade the cookie below asks for.
REMOTE_COMPONENTS = os.getenv("YTDLP_REMOTE_COMPONENTS", "ejs:github")

# The second is a proof-of-origin token provider: a sidecar that mints the
# tokens YouTube wants from clients it trusts, with no account and no API key
# behind it. bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider is installed as a yt-dlp plugin (see
# pyproject.toml) and sits inert until this names a provider to ask, which is
# what keeps a local checkout working with nothing running beside it.
POT_PROVIDER_URL = os.getenv("POT_PROVIDER_URL", "").rstrip("/")

# Where the solver script and player caches land. Worth a volume: without one
# every container restart re-downloads them on the first extraction of the
# day, which is slow and noisy rather than broken.
CACHE_DIR = os.getenv("YTDLP_CACHE_DIR", "")

# The real fix for the datacenter-IP block. Cookies and the token provider help
# but do not guarantee YouTube from a VPS range — a flagged address gets
# LOGIN_REQUIRED before either can act. Egress from a non-datacenter address is
# the only thing that reliably clears it, which means a residential or ISP
# proxy. Set HTTPS_PROXY (or YTDLP_PROXY to override just yt-dlp) to route every
# extraction and download through one. Empty means direct, which is right at
# home and the thing that fails on a rented server. SoundCloud needs none of it.
PROXY_URL = os.getenv("YTDLP_PROXY", os.getenv("HTTPS_PROXY", "")).strip()

# The third is a cookies.txt exported from a signed-in browser. On a VPS this
# is not the last resort it reads like: YouTube answers a flagged address with
# LOGIN_REQUIRED at the playability check, before a token is asked for and
# before a challenge exists to solve, so neither of the two above ever gets to
# help. The cost is tying every download to one account — YouTube bans
# accounts for exactly this, so it wants a throwaway, not a real one.
#
# A path that isn't there is ignored rather than passed on — a stale variable
# would otherwise fail every extraction the process ever makes. That failure
# used to be silent, which made a missing mount look exactly like a mount
# that wasn't helping; status() below is how an operator tells them apart.

    YouTube rotates these cookies as they are spent, and yt-dlp saves the new

    read-only cookie file worse than no cookie at all: extraction succeeds,
    close() raises PermissionError afterwards, and since that is not a
    ProviderError it leaves as a 500 with the real cause buried in a traceback.

    Which is exactly what a mounted file is. Dokploy writes its File Mounts as
    root while the container runs as appuser, and chown would only hold until
    the next deploy rewrote it. So the mount is treated as a seed rather than
    as the session: it is copied onto the cache volume and the rotation happens
    there, where it also survives a restart. Editing the file in Dokploy takes
    effect on the next boot, because the copy is refreshed whenever the mount
